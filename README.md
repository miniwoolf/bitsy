# Bitsy
Bitsy is a little editor for games, worlds, or stories.
The goal is to make it easy to make games where you can walk around and talk to people and be somewhere!

# Make a game with Bitsy
You can use [the Bitsy editor](https://ledoux.itch.io/bitsy) in your browser on itch.io! When you've finished your game, you can download it as an html file and share it. :)
